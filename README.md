I——an unknown 13-year-old OS enthusiast
  My true name is Liang Daan, I am a 13-year-old boy from a fourth-tier city in China. I come from an ordinary with average economic conditions, but I like to self-study and research operating systems.
  I researched Windows BCD a few days ago and used the Visual BCD tool, which is more intuitive than PowerShell and quite useful. I learned a lot aboutCD with it, such as the basic knowledge of {bootmgr}, application osloader, and also understood the applicationdevice, applicationpath, OSdevice, and the sath, parameters, and values of device option.I also learned that only the PE WIM file can use "ramdisk [boot]"
  I am going to learn Windows ADK next, and I plan to build a PE wim file, but the problem is that the home computer has very little, while the store computer has more memory, but it is running Windows 7. The store computer has installed Windows 11 before, but it crashed later, so I dare install Windows 11 again. After self-learning Windows ADK
  Can anyone give me some advice?
